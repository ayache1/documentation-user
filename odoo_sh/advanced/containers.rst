==================================
Containers
==================================

Overview
========

Each build is isolated within its own container (Linux namespaced container).

The base is an Ubuntu 16.04 system, where are installed all required Odoo dependencies
as well as common useful packages.

The Odoo.sh team is open to install any system packages
as long as they are distributed by the official Ubuntu repositories.
`Leave us a feedback <https://www.odoo.sh/feedback>`_ if you would like a package which is not yet installed.

If your project requires Python dependencies not installed by default in the container, or more recent releases,
you can define a *requirements.txt* file, listing your Python modules dependencies,
in the root of your branches. The platform will take care to install these dependencies in your containers.
`The pip requirements specifiers <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#requirement-specifiers>`_
documentation can help you to know how to write a *requirements.txt* file.
To have a concrete example,
check out the `requirements.txt file of Odoo <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/11.0/requirements.txt>`_.

The *requirements.txt* files of submodules are taken into account as well. The platform
looks for *requirements.txt* files in each folders containing Odoo modules: Not in the module folder itself,
but in their parent folder.

Directory structure
===================

As the containers are Ubuntu based, their directory structure follows the linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.
`Ubuntu's filesystem tree overview <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview#Main_directories>`_
explains the main directories.

The Odoo.sh pertinent directories are presented in the below list:

::

  .
  ├── home
  │    └── odoo
  │         ├── src

       │    ├── python3
       │         └── dist-packages       Python 3 standard libraries
       │    └── python3.5

       ├── local

       │              └── dist-packages  Python 3.5 third-party libraries
       └── usr
            └── bin
                 ├── python2.7           Python 2.7 executable
                 └── python3.5           Python 3.5 executable

Both Python 2.7 and 3.5 are installed in the containers. However:

* If your project is configured to use Odoo 10.0, the Odoo server runs with Python 2.7.
* If your project is configured to use Odoo 11.0, the Odoo server runs with Python 3.5.

Database shell
==============

While accessing a container with the shell, you can access the database using *psql*.

.. code-block:: bash

  odoo@odoo-addons-master-1.odoo.sh:~$ psql
  psql (9.5.2, server 9.5.11)
  SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
  Type "help" for help.

  odoo-addons-master-1=>

**Be careful !**
Use transactions (*BEGIN...COMMIT/ROLLBACK*) for every *sql* requests leading to changes
(*UPDATE*, *DELETE*, *ALTER*, ...), especially for your production database.

It happens to be distracted, and the transaction mechanism may save you.
Indeed, it gives you the opportunity to rollback your changes in case you make a mistake.

For example, it may happen that you forget to set your *WHERE* condition.

.. code-block:: sql

  odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
  BEGIN
  odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***';
  UPDATE 457
  odoo-addons-master-1=> ROLLBACK;
  ROLLBACK

In such a case, you can rollback to revert the unwanted changes that you just mistakenly did, and rewrite the request:

.. code-block:: sql

  odoo-addons-master-1=> BEGIN;
  BEGIN
  odoo-addons-master-1=> UPDATE res_users SET password = '***' WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE 1
  odoo-addons-master-1=> COMMIT;
  COMMIT

However, do not forget to either commit or rollback your request after having done it.
An opened transaction may have locked records in your tables,
and your running database may wait for them to be released. It can cause a server to hang up indefinitely.

In addition, when possible, use your staging databases to test your requests first. It gives you an extra safety ney.

Run an Odoo server
==================

You can start an Odoo server instance from a container shell. You won't be able to access it from the outside world
with a browser, but you can for instance:

* use the Odoo shell,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  ~/src/odoo/odoo-bin shell -d odoo-addons-master-1 --addons-path=~/src/user,~/src/enterprise,~/src/themes,~/src/odoo/addons,~/src/odoo/odoo/addons --workers=0 --max-cron-threads=0
  >>> partner = env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1)
  >>> partner.name
  'ASUSTeK'
  >>> partner.name = 'Odoo'
  >>> env['res.partner'].search([('email', '=', 'asusteK@yourcompany.example.com')], limit=1).name
  'Odoo'

* install a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  ~/src/odoo/odoo-bin -d odoo-addons-master-1 --addons-path=~/src/user,~/src/enterprise,~/src/themes,~/src/odoo/addons,~/src/odoo/odoo/addons -i sale --workers=0 --max-cron-threads=0 --stop-after-init

* update a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  ~/src/odoo/odoo-bin -d odoo-addons-master-1 --addons-path=~/src/user,~/src/enterprise,~/src/themes,~/src/odoo/addons,~/src/odoo/odoo/addons -u sale --workers=0 --max-cron-threads=0 --stop-after-init

* run the tests for a module,

.. code-block:: bash

  $  ~/src/odoo/odoo-bin -d odoo-addons-master-1 --addons-path=~/src/user,~/src/enterprise,~/src/themes,~/src/odoo/addons,~/src/odoo/odoo/addons -i sale --test-enable --log-level=test --workers=0 --max-cron-threads=0 --stop-after-init

In the above commands, the argument:

* *--addons-path* is to specify the directories containing the modules,
  the part *~/src/user* can vary, according to your branch code structure,
* *--workers=0* is to run your server using multi-threading instead of multiple workers,
* *--max-cron-threads=0* is to prevent the scheduled tasks to run.
* *--stop-after-init* is to immediately shutdown the server instance after it completed the operations you asked.

You can find in the logs (*~/logs/odoo.log*) the addons path used by Odoo.sh to run your server.
Look for "*odoo: addons paths*":

**Be careful**, especially with your production database.
Operations that you perform running this Odoo server instance are not isolated:
Changes will be effective in the database. As much as possible, make your tests in your staging databases.
